# Product Unity Project

This Unity project contains the source code for both scenes which were created for the experiments outlined in the report.
This project was created using Unity v5.3.4, and compatibility with other versions is unknown.

Scripts and Assets outside of the ``./Assets/NEGeo`` , ``./Assets/Models`` , or ``./Assets/Materials`` directories are from external sources, unless otherwise stated.

This product was designed for use with an Oculus Rift Developer Kit 2, running the 0.8 Beta SDK, and compatibility with other devices or versions is unknown.
Note that although the project was designed for use with the Oculus Rift DK2, it can be ran and navigated without one attached, with it rendering on a regular display.
The control scheme for navigating the scenes are ``W``/``S``/``A``/``D`` to move, and ``Q``/``E`` to turn.

The scenes which were used for the experiments are the ``./Assets/NEGeo/Scenes/Standard.unity`` and ``./Assets/NEGeo/Scenes/Non-Euclidean-Full.unity`` files.
