\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

	The aim of this project was to gain an insight into the effects of non-Euclidean geometry on a users sense of immersion in Virtual Environments, more specifically when in Virtual Reality.
	To do this, test scenes were created using both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry which could be used to gather feedback. % TODO: Reword this? make it longer?
	Results from the experiments conducted indicate that immersion is not only possible when in a non-Euclidean virtual environment, but it can in the right circumstances increase a users sense of immersion.

	% continue this train of thought, 'taking this into account, the results from the experiments conducted indicate...'

	The results from the experiments open up room for future research into the subject area, such as the effects different control methods such as gamepad or room-scale motion tracking have on a users sense of immersion in a non-Euclidean environment, or perhaps how different effects of non-Euclidean space individually effect a users sense of immersion.

	% TODO - Here is where I will conclude the report as a whole, covering the results of the experiment, how they match up to the information learned from the existing literature review, as well as any further work which could be done on the subject area.
