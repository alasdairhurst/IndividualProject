%\begin{abstract}
%	With Virtual Reality (VR) development and availability increasing as rapidly as it has in recent years, especially in the video game market, experiences that are capable from Virtual Environments (VE) that are not limited to the restrictions of the real world need to be considered.
%	This review explores the existing literature that covers the various requirements for creating a VE that consumers would perceive as 'realistic' in VR. As well as this, it also covers how these requirements have been, and can, be adapted to work inside of a world which does not follow the restrictions of real world %geometry, such as in non-Euclidean or Escheresque space.
%	Gaps in the current literature are outlined, alongside perspective areas for future research.
