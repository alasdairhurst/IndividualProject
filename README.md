# Individual Project

This repository contains the report and product I have developed for my individual project module during my fourth year at the University of Huddersfield.

## Abstract

With Virtual Reality (VR) development and availability increasing as rapidly as it has in recent years, experiences that are capable from Virtual Environments that are not limited to the restrictions of the real world, and the effectiveness they have in a users perception and sense of immersion, need to be considered.
Studies surrounding a user's interaction in VR environments that have taken place previously tend to focus on how reliably the user can interact with an environment mimicking the real world.
This study attempts to fill the gap in existing research by examining the effects non-Euclidean geometry has on a users sense of immersion in VR.
Experiments were undertaken to gauge users senses of immersion in both standard and non-Euclidean virtual environments, as well as the effects of transitioning between the two environment types.
Results of the experiments show that non-Euclidean environments do not have a negative impact on users sense of immersion in VR.
As well as this, when transitioning from Euclidean to non-Euclidean environments, immersion in the scenes can increase.
